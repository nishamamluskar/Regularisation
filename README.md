Overfitted models are the one with low bias and high variance.
Thus to reduce the problem of overfitting we use Regularisation techniques.
L1 Regularisation- Lasso Regression
L2 Regularisation- Ridge Regressioin
Hybrid of L1 and L2 - Elastic Net Regression
Ideology- This techniques will increase the bias so that the variance becomes low. This creates bias- variance tradeoff. It will give us an ideal model.
